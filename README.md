# Food-Image-Calorie-Tracker
The purpose of this project is to create a program that can 
1. When taking a photo on a phone, it should be able to recognize what the food is, and provide a ballpark caloric estimate and nutrition info.
2. The user should have complete control over to history, and the app should be able to give recommendations based on personal fitness and activity metrics.
3. It's an android app that uses the google gemini API to evaluate images while giving individualized feedback to the user about dietary reccommendations and habits, and potential warning indicators.

## How it Connects to Reinventing the Wheel
Calorie trackers are a common tool used to help improve personal habits and discipline. This app seeks to reinvent that by improving on common gripes like difficulty in determining the true caloric content of a food, etc.
