# Calorie Cam
This program was created using python and implemented Streamlit for developing the web based UI, SQLite for database organization and querying, and google gemini's API for image recognition and description.

## Reinventing the Wheel
Calorie trackers are a common tool used to help improve personal habits and discipline. This app seeks to reinvent that by improving on common gripes like difficulty in determining the true caloric content of a food, uncertainties about meal portion sizes, and usefulness as a general health tool.
